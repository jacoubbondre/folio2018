Budweiser is also a brand that will reward overinvestment if it bears fruit.</p><p>Because of that dynamic, I was able to allocate resources on my teams for research and development.  From those R&D hours we were able to create innovative and successful experience for inBev and their consumers.</p><p>Grip’s innovation team created real-time 3D and Physics engines for the web that led to the Bobbleheads campaign in both Canada and the USA.  Our dynamic color replacement experiment lead to the “Show your true colours” Bud United app for the world cup.  Actively engaging 2.7 million people, and added close to a million new members to Budweiser’s facebook page.</p><p>The last project I worked on with Bud was the original Redlight launch.  I can’t wait until the next time I get to create something unique and cool with these brands again.</p>',hasVideo:true,vidURL:"<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/64225306' frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>",imageURL:'../../images/budRedlights.jpg', highlights:'<ul><li>Red Lights - Orginial Launch</li><li>Bud United - Show your true colours</li><li>Bud Light - Bobble heads</li><li>Kokanee - Next Ranger</li></ul>'},

Moreover their E-Comm site is integrated into their instore POS system.  Did I mention that the POS system was based on windows 7 and IE?</p><p>Our job was to do the design, UX, and implementation of the presentation layer, on an aging Demandware(old commerce cloud) infrastructure.  Initially the site was not working on the POS systems.</p><p>Being the Lead Technologist on the project it was my job to travel onsite, diagnose, and propose a solution to the problem.  In the end, my recommendations not only helped get the POS system up and running for holiday sales, but it gave the Roots team the info they needed to get an upgrade to their POS system approved.</p>',hasVideo:false,vidURL:"",imageURL:'../../images/roots.jpg', highlights:'<ul><li>Fully Responsive</li><li>Managed teams in Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, and India</li><li>Mobile Optimization</li></ul>'},

I was hired at Transistor to build their digital department after winning the Hyundai -Think About It- project from Goodby</p><p>The proof of concept was built by perfect fools, but there were issues during dev, that caused the Goodby team to look to Transistor, who had come up with the concept, to finish the solution</p><p>From there we made award winning work for brands like Pepsi Co, with Cheetos.com and the Now Propelled campaign. We did some innovative work with Sprint, integrating real-time gameplay with prerecorded assets and real-time 3D. And other fun projects for brands like Ray Ban, Dr. Pepper and Quaker.</p>',hasVideo:true,vidURL:"<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/304152247' frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>",imageURL:'../../images/transistor.jpg', highlights:'<ul><li>Created Digital Discpline</li><li>Trained existined staff</li><li>Cheetos</li><li>Sprint</li><li>Hyundai</li><li>RayBan</li></ul>'},

They had been trying to establish a digital department for a couple of years.  While they were able to produce some very compelling work, the process was painful for client, and unprofitable for the agency.</p><p>I was named as co-chair of the interactive management team, and personally tabled and championed the inclusion of social media as a discipline, as well was sit on the operations team with Randy Stein, spearheading the transformation of Grip from a mass, to media agonistic agency.</p><p>By the end of my tenure, digital revenue was up 400% and profitability was up 10 points.</p><p>With all of those wins, I still say my biggest contribution to the agency was cultural, as I fostered an environment of experimentation and learning.  Check out Budweiser for more on that.</p>',hasVideo:true,vidURL:"",imageURL:'../../images/grip.jpg', highlights:'<ul><li>Director of Production</li><li>Director of Innovation and Technology</li><li>Interactive Managment Team Chair</li><li>Operations and Change Managment</li><li>Mentorship and Learning</li></ul>'},

Think About It was a dream campaign for me to work on.  It had high quality content, games, engaging visuals, and new technology few were familiar with at the time.  Such as AS3 and Papervision.</p><p>The initial build failed due to it spiking user memory into the Gigs, back in 2007, this was enough to crash a computer.  My task, along with Chris Eyerman of 3AM fame, was to redo the UX, and rebuild the app in a way to better manage memory.  The result is an international award winning site, and an international award winning campaign.</p><p>Today I am still working on Hyundai, maintaining and updating their Canadian dealer application.</p>',hasVideo:true,vidURL:"<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/304151417' frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>",imageURL:'../../images/hyundai.jpg', highlights:'<ul><li>Think About It</li><li>Several Sales Events</li><li>Dealer Application</li><li>Driving too fast in an 1996 Sonota</li></ul>'},

My job was not only to build the core site and framework, but to also manage teams from 4 other companies. Development completed over the 2007 Xmas holidays.  The client was so pleased with the result, the microsite became the main brand site for years to come.</p><p>The nowPropelled app we built as a campaign piece for Propel Vitamin Water. You could enter up to 5 destinations and using the maps API and a bunch of custom server code, will give you the path of least resistance to do your chores.

Or enter in exact addresses of where you want to go.</p>',hasVideo:true,vidURL:"<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/225988640' frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>",imageURL:'../../images/pepsico.jpg', highlights:'<ul><li>Cheetos.com</li><li>Legend of the Cheetocorn</li><li>Now Propelled</li><li>Gatorade</li></ul>'}
