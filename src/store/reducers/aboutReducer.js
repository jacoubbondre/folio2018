        {copy:"<h1>BETA ACCESS!!!</h1><p>I assure you this is not vaporware.  I am just really busy. I haven't had a proper site I designed and built myself since 2008.  Thatâ€™s a decade of not expressing myself. Ugh.  Well I still don't have time.  So eventually this section will be all interactive and cool, but for now you get the pretty generic, but SEO valuable, QnA</p><hr /><h2>What is your approach to technology?</h2><p>Technology is an enabler, always has been.  Since the dawn of time, technology has made things easier for people to do.  The wheel didn't make it easier for highly skilled engineers but increased the cost of animal pelts! Same should be true for modern technology.  Especially technology you pay for.  If the $250,000.00 CMS you just license is making it hard for you to do anything, it probably wasn't implemented right. Technology is a facilitator. If you have a creative idea, technology should help you bring it to life. It should not be a barrier to said creation.</p><hr /><h2>How do you manage people?</h2><p>In technology, the people are the product. You are not shipping anything without a competent and productive development team.  On that same note, I am one person. At the end of the day it doesn't matter how well I code, it matters how well I can get my team to code. My job is to amplify productivity.<p>Research on motivation shows that people are looking for three things in their career.  Mastery, Autonomy, and Purpose - Dan Pink.  As a manager I have control over two of those three pillars.  Setting up an environment, where each employee is not just given the opportunity to grow, but small incremental improvements are baked into the expectations of their roles. For that to be successful, project lifecycles need to be managed as well, so people can make the odd mistake as they grow, without immense stress, and without tanking the project.</p><hr /><h2>What was the maximum number of people you manage at once?</h2><p>As Director of Production at Grip I had 90 direct and Indirect reports.</p><hr /><h2>Who designed your site?</h2><p>Ugh, I did.  Its ok, I need to crispy it up.  But as with most personal projects its about pushing the boundaries of something.  With this work in progress site, I am trying to create a very accessible, and SEO friendly, responsive site, that is lightweight, and very rich.  This site uses CSS-Grid.  BTWs if you are on a Microsoft browser you are getting the mobile experience. I will be testing edge support shortly :P.  All of this is to say that I want the foundation perfect before I start adding the panache.</p><hr /><h2>Who built your site</h2><p>I did.  Going to keep it as a public repo so people can pull the code.  Maybe learn from it.</p><hr /><h2>What is one thing people should know about you when it comes to business?</h2><p>I care deeply for the people and brands I work with.  I will always put the strategic goals of the brand above all else, and I will fight to ensure everyone I work with has what they need to succeed.  I will not stop in this pursuit.</p>"}
